Script name: sga_assemble.pl

This is a script to assemble parsed reads by SGA

Dependencies:
(1) SGA
(2) Perl Module:
	Parallel::ForkManager

Example usage:
	
	perl sga_assemble.pl --parsed bandpout --assembled sgaout --samplelist samplelist.txt

(1) bandpout
(2) samplelist.txt

Output files:
(1) sgaout

Options:
--parsed
  Directory containing parsed reads 
--samplelist
  A list of sample name. Only samples in the list will be assembled
--assembled
  Directory containing assembled reads and string graphs
--min_overlap
  Minimum overlap required between 2 reads, $minolp in default
--error_rate
  Maximum error rate allowed to consider two sequences aligned, $errorate in default
--cpu
  Limit the number of CPUs, $process in default.
